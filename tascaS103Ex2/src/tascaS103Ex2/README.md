# List Reverser Exercise

## 📄 Description
This exercise demonstrates the implementation of a list reversal operation in Java using ListIterator. The program creates an initial list of numbers from 1 to 10 and creates a new list with the elements in reverse order.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- Java SE 8+
- ArrayList
- ListIterator
- Maven (for project management)

## 📋 Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or similar)
- Maven (optional)

## 🛠️ Installation
1. Clone the repository: 

```bash
git clone [github.com/MaraMarchello/S1.03-Ex2-Java-Language-Nivel-1/tree/main/tascaS103Ex2]
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd src/tascaS103Ex2
```
3. Import the project into your preferred IDE

## ▶️ Implementation
1. Open the project in your IDE
2. Locate the `ListReverser.java` file
3. Run the main method
4. The program will display both the original and reversed lists in the console

### Example Output:
First List (original order):
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Second List (reverse order):
[10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

## 🌐 Deployment
This is a simple console application and doesn't require deployment. It can be run directly from any Java IDE or command line.
